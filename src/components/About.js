      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a final-year Software Engineering student at Macquarie University with a strong passion for building practical, impactful technology. I’ve developed a range of projects across Java, C++, JavaScript, and Python, including full-stack applications and agent-to-agent communication systems. I’ve been tech-focused my entire life, and I’m driven by a desire to solve complex problems, learn quickly, and create software that genuinely makes a difference.
